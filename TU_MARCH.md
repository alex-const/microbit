## Microbit Homework before the actual day:

Choose any topic from https://www.microbit.co.uk/blocks/lessons, develop it and bring your work along when you come to Credit Suisse.

Some of the topics you can try are:
1. "Rotation Animation" - using the commands you learned for "Flashing heart" and a more advanced command "while"
2. creating a "Die roll" - this should be very similar to the Rock Paper Scissors game we coded last time
3. "Glowing Pendulum" - remember or learn how to read the accelerometer
4. "Hero" game - create your own game! Recommended for the students that are more advanced and confident in their skills.

## Research for the actual day:  

In regards to the coming Womenâ€™s Day, we want you to learn about **Grace Hopper**, **Ada Lovelace** and their contribution to the computer as we see it today.

Here are a few starter links for you to read on:

We will have some fun games to quiz you on the knowledge you gain from these readings.
