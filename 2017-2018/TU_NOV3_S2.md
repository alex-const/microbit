# Session 2

## Choose an Idea!

### Hot or Cold
* [Hot or Cold](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hot-or-cold) - In this game, players are looking for hidden micro:bit that emit radio signals. 
* Skills: variables, logic, radio, arrays (advanced).

### Stopwatch
* [Stopwatch](/Instructions/Stopwatch/Stopwatch.md) - Build your own stopwatch.
* :bulb: Learn:
  * Advanced input values.
  * Practice working with variables.
  * :question: Questions:
  1. What happens if you press the button A again while the stopwatch is running? How can you fix the problem?
  2. If the stopwatch runs for a long time, it will become harder to know how many minutes pass. Can you change the code to display the lapsed seconds as minutes and seconds : 01:45 ?

### Stopwatch advanced
* [Stopwatch advanced](/Instructions/Stopwatch_multiple_timers/Stopwatch_advanced.md) - Improve your stopwatch so it can count multiple intervals at once.
* :bulb: Learn:
  * Read and add values to an array.
  * :question: Questions:
   1. After the stopwatch is stopped (pressed button A+B), what happenes if you start it again? Press button A and see if you can figure out what is going on.
* [PathChaser simple](/Instructions/PathChaser/PathChaser_simple.md) - Build a simple game using the microbit accelerometer
* :bulb: Learn:
  * Advanced input - accelerometer.
  * Turning on / off a single led point
  * Loop with pre-condition
  * :question: Questions:
   1. The portal is placed randomly on the board. What if the location on the portal is 2,2 - same as the initial location of the path chaser? Can we do something to make sure this never happens?
   2. Can you change the code so that we can play more than once?
   3. What other game features could we add - what about a pause button?
